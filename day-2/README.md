## SOMEHOW I HAVE EVEN MORE SKILL ISSUES IN LUA THAN I HAVE IN IN RUBY

Interesting things:
* Lua is actually a beautiful language
* Language created by and for the craftsman
* Brazil

Things I hage:
* Same as Ruby, uses ```end```, but worse (```then```, ```do```, etc...), overall too much English for a language made by people that are  not actually native speakers.
* What the actuall h*ck is ```~=```
* There are no arrays, and even without arrays iterations start at number 1?
