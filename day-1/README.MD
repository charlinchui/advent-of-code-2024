## I DEFINITELY HAVE SKILL ISSUES WITH RUBY

### Interesting things:

* Pretty easy and simple to implement
* array.sort! method is pretty useful
* Print is puts but print is also print. Puts adds an /n after every item to print

### Things I hate:

* Ending everything with ```end``` should be illegal
* What do you mean you dont have :, ; or { }
* Not a strongly typed language

### Impressions:

I feel like the language is ok for scripting tasks and and stuff like that.
